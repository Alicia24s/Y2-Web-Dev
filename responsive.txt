Things I did:


I put in multiple pages with different themes.

I put in the Javascript that connects to the API.

I tried to have the home page have a core background and the other pages have
a uniform structure but different pictures.

I made sure that the Nav is stuck to the screen so that when you scroll it doesn't disappear and 
also took the time to change the Nav bar and the footer depending on which page you're on so that 
the user doesn't have links to the page they're on.

I also put in a 'flex' command in css so that the areas of my article can reverse. This was myfavorite thing
to put in because before, when everything was on the same side, everything looked too uniform and this made it less boring.

I made a custom image for the home button on the nav in the top left and put the mail list on there so 
that on any given page the user can still sign up.

Whilst there are areas of improvement, It generally has the functionalities needed for an okay website. This isn't 
a very popular artist so it was hard to find reams of information about them.
